Assignment 1:
    1. Line 18 caused the segmentation fault.
    2. You can fix the error by inputing the address of the variable input as opposed to the value of the variable.
    3. The variable sum is being passed by reference into the read_values() function instead of by pointer.
    4. This can be fixed by sending the function read_values() the location of sum and altering that as opposed to the local version of the variable.
    
Assignment 2:
    1. Yes, the results are what would be expected from appending the first string to the second.
    2. No, the output recieved is not to be expected. The program output HI!hi!hello! instead of HI!hi!. This can be fixed by adding a for loop inside the while loop that sets all values of str1 and str2 to NULL.
    3. No, the output is not expected. I believe this happens because the original strings were given a maximum size of 10.
