TPS 2:
    1. type gcc punishment.c -g -o punish
    2. type gdb punish
    3. type run or r
    4. A breakpoint is a place in your code that you set for the program to stop and allow you to see that line. You set a breakpoint by typing b <line>. I set mine at 32.
    5. Run program line by line by typing n or next
    6. type print or p
    7. type continue or c
    8. type quit or q

TPS 3:
    1. there are 4 variables and 2 pointers. the pointers are called *px and *py
    2. They will be random because the integers weren't declared. This was proved by running the program and checking the values of x, y, and arr.
    3. You can prevent random values by setting the integers to something, like 0.
    4. Done in pointers.c
    5. Done in pointers.c
    6. Because *arr = arr[i] and *(arr + 1) = arr[1], we can create a loop that prints *(arr + i) for every value from 0 to 10.
    7. They are and the code has been added to pointers.c
    8. The result makes sense because they are all pointing to the same value.
