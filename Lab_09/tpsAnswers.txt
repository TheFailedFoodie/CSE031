    4. Each basic machine instruction takes only 32 bits, or 4 bytes.
    5. The three different types of machine instructions in MIPS are called I-format, J-format, and R-format instructions.
    6. Line #7
        a. Line 7 is an example of an I-format instruction. this type of instruction has 4 fields. They are called the destination field, the source field, the immediate field, and the opcode.
        b. The opcode value in hex for line #7 is 8. rs is at register $s0. The value of this register in hex is 10. rt is register $zero. it's value in hex is 0. The value of the immediate in hex is 19.
        c. 001000 00000 10000 0000000000011001, 0x20100019
    7. Converting code
        a. The machine code at this address in hex is 0x0230402a. In binary, that is 000000 10001 10000 01000 00000 101010
        b. The instruction type is R-format. You can tell because of the reference sheet and the front 6 bits being 0. In this instruction type, there are 6 types of fields; opcode, rs, rt, rd, shant, and funct.
        c. opcode = 0, rs = 11, rt = 10, rd = 8, shant = 0, funct = 2a
        d. This operation is slt. you are using $s1, $s0, and $t0.
        e. The final operation is slt $t0 $s1 $s0
    8. Converting code again
        a. bne is an I-Format instruction.
        b. opcode is 5, rs is 8, rt is 0
        c. Name of target label is LESS, address of this label is 0x0040001c in hex.
        d. No, because we can't fit a 32 bit address into a 16 bit location.
        e. find the relative address by counting the number of lines between the call instruction until we reach the branch location, in this case, 1. It is 0000000000000001 in binary and 1 in hex.
        f. Machine code binary = 000101 01000 000000000000000000001, machine code hex = 0x15000001
    9. Converting one more time
        a. This instruction is in J-format. there are only 2 fields for this type of instruction
        b. opcode in hex = 2
        c. this instruction jumps to label GREQ at address 0x00400030
        d. you are able to use 26 bits for the address label. Value in binary = 00000100000000000000001100
        e. machine code in binary = 000010 00000100000000000000001100, in hex = 0x0810000c.
