TPS 1:
    1. The starting address of the text segment is 0x00400000 and the starting address of the data segment is 0x10010000.
    2. The basic section is harder to read and understand because it is meant to be understood only by the computer. The source segment is exactly what was written in MIPS.
    3. There is a difference of 8 bytes between the two data segments.
    4. There are 8 collums.
    5. I assume each collum coresponds to each individual byte.
    6. under the .data tag, you write m:    word. 20.
    7. The new variable is stored at 0x10010004.
    8. Done
    9. str1 is stored at address 0x10010008.
    10. Yes, this display agrees with Lab_04.
    11. Done
    12. la $t3, n loads the address of n into the register $t3. After running the instruction, the value of $t3 will be the address of n.

TPS 2:
    1. You don't need a different operation for each inequality because you can combine multiple operations to produce the same effect.
    2. Done
    3. Done
    4. Done
    5. Done
    6.
